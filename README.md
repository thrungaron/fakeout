# Fakeout Java Source Code
This repository contains the Java source code for the game Fakeout, a riff/variation on Steve Wozniak's 1976 classic Breakout. Fakeout was designing using the [Processing](https://processing.org/) framework, and building the source code will require the appropriate libraries to create the .jar files and executable file. Compiled executables and .jar files for Windows32 and Windows64 are provided in case rebuilding the project proves challenging. The compiled exe also has a dependency on an old version of the Java Runtime, and since the installer for that runtime is larger than Github will allow, a link to the [Java Archive](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html) is provided here. You will have to register a free account with Oracle, at which point you will need to download Java SE Development Kit 8u74. This game was created for a [custom-built arcade machine](https://mickeydelp.com/blog/led-matrix) designed by Mickey Delp of [Delptronics](https://delptronics.com/) that used programmable LED strips for the game screen, classic joystick and buttons for player input, and MIDI for music and sound effects. In addition to designing the machine itself, Mickey also created a game launcher in C++ that ran on the [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) microcontroller that powered the arcade machine. Fakeout was one of six games that were created to be playable on the Teensy game launcher for the LED arcade cabinet. The games were displayed to the public at multiple locations across Texas in 2017, including at [The Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum](https://www.thestoryoftexas.com/visit/calendar/pop-up-exhibit-maker-faire-20171228) for a Maker Faire popup, and at an [EFF-Austin cyberpunk party](https://effaustin.org/march-11th-eff-austin-presents-cyberpunk-2017-rushing-to-meet-our-real-imagined-future/) featuring Cory Doctorow and Bruce Sterling.
